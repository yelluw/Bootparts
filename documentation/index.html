                <p>
                  Bootparts are a collection of Bootstrap 3 components that simplify the process of building websites.
                  The project is being developed because I wanted to reduce the time spent writing custom HTML / CSS.
                  The Bootstrap framework provides a great starting point, but I wanted more. This is the result of that.
                  </p>

                <p class="faq-answer">

                  conventions we use internally. We do digital marketing (among other things), thus the names.
                </p>

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  A: Bootstrap version 4 had not been officially released when this project came to be.

                  <a href="https://github.com/yelluw/Bootparts/blob/master/bootparts/action-card/action-card.css">CSS</a> <br>
                  The action card component is used to include a clear call to action in any part of the layout. It is commonly
                  used to persuade the visitor to subscribe to a newsletter or download a resource. This is more useful than using
                  a pop up and provides a better user experience.
                </p>

                  The call to action bar is meant to be used at the top of the page. It includes a simple form
                  for visitors to input their email address. On smaller screens the bar collapses and the form stops being inline.
                  This is done on purpose to make it stand out.
                </p>

                  The call to action button is meant to be used like the action card, except that this one is smaller and less intrusive.
                  You can also use it at the top of the page to alert users of a special event or offer.
                </p>

                  <a href="https://github.com/yelluw/Bootparts/blob/master/bootparts/center-aligned-headline/center-aligned-headline.css">CSS</a> <br>
                  The center aligned headline is used to break up the flow of copy and the movement of eyes between elements.
                  The contrast of dark background and white font is for the purpose of showcasing it. Note that it is not a <code>&lt;h1></code> tag, but a <code>&lt;p></code> tag. 
                </p>

                The hero brand two buttons component is meant to be used above the fold. It features an area where you can put the brand name
                of whatever product you are selling, a clear headline, two buttons, and a caption under the buttons. It was designed to
                be used in the Bootparts project main page, but can be used to as a component with two call to actions. It does not collapse.
                On smaller screens the headline stands out from the other elements on purpose. The headline is not a <code>&lt;h1></code> tag, but a <code>&lt;p></code> tag. 
                </p>

                   The hero subscription form component is used to persuade visitors to subscribe to an email newsletter. On smaller screens
                   the form covers the width of the screen (minus padding). This is done on purpose. It is meant to be at the top of the page.
