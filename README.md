# Bootparts
A collection of Bootstrap components that make building websites much easier. 

## Features

- Ready-to-use responsive components.

- Minimized CSS that makes including it in your website simple.

- Three complete templates that you can use for your project.

- No need to use Javascript. Jquery is included along with Bootstrap's JS for convenience. But its not required for anything.
